## Manual Testing

A comprehensive manual testing process has been employed on this project. All areas of functionality on the site were tested repeatedly throughout development, and the results recorded below.

## HTML/CSS Validation
![html & css](./media/testing/spreadsheet/html_css.png)

CSS validation was carried out with the Jigsaw CSS Validator service. There was only a small amount of custom CSS included in this project, with most of the styling being done through bootstrap classes. There were no errors returned, with one warning which is due to a limitation of how Jigsaw operates.

HTML Validation was carried out with the W3C validator. An early version of the site flagged an error where I the links in the drop-down menu were incorrectly wrapped in just 'a' tags rather than 'li' tags as well, this error was fixed and no further problems occurred.

## Python Validation
![python](./media/testing/spreadsheet/python.png)

The Autopep8 package which comes with the Code Institute template was used to fix Python formatting errors in all files. This removed whitespace, fixed line spacing etc. There are a small number of errors remaining on setting.py and models.py . These are errors for lines being too long, and are due to a Cloudinary URL string and 4 Django authorization method names. All files were checked agains the [PEP8 validator](http://pep8online.com).

## Accessibility
![access](./media/testing/spreadsheet/accessibility.png)
Accessibility testing was carried out with the [WAVE tool](https://wave.webaim.org/), all pages returned no errors found. All tags were properly filled in and there were no low-contrast areas of the side which would be difficult for users with poor vision. It should be noted that the online WAVE tool was only able to check pages where the user was not logged in. To check those pages I installed the Wave Chrome Extension which lets you check any page.

## Navigation
![nav](./media/testing/spreadsheet/navigation.png)
This test case is to verify that all the main links in the navbar take the user to the correct page. These links were tested by multiple people on different devices over a number of days. All tests were passed with no problems.

## Browse Reviews
![browse reviews](./media/testing/spreadsheet/browse_reviews.png)
This functionality is available to both registered and unregistered users. This test case confirms that a user can browse through the selection of book reviews on the site, use pagination, select a review and see the details of that review.

## Reviews CRUD Functionality
![reviews crud](./media/testing/spreadsheet/reviews_crud.png)
The Review model is the main component of this project, and it is important to verify that all Create, Read, Update and Delete functionality works flawlessly. Users can log into the site and create a new review. They can then look at the details of the review, edit or delete the review. This process was tested many times over the course of development and works perfectly.

## Comments CRUD Functionality
![comments cruds](./media/testing/spreadsheet/comments_crud.png)
The Create, Read, Update and Delete operations all function as expected for user comments. There were some initial problems early in development with attaching the comments to a review, but once I removed the slug field and used integer based ID fields to identify comments and reviews, this worked perfectly.

## Wishlist CRUD Functionality
![wishlist crud](./media/testing/spreadsheet/wishlist_crud.png)
The user wishlist is the third model that also utilises CRUD operations. Each user can add and remove books from their list, as well as toggling their status between read and unread. The site behaved as expected and no problems occurred.

## User Account
![account](./media/testing/spreadsheet/user_account.png)
There is a large amount of important functionality connected with the user profile. This area has been tested exhaustively to ensure everything works correctly. Django's built-in user management is very good, and using the AllAuth package has made handling user registration, login and logout, and password resets much easier to handle. I used the Sendgrid API for email delivery as it works better than a personal Gmail account. The site can email a new user to verify their account, and use the same email to reset their password if needed. The user can also delete their account if they wish.

## Search
![search](./media/testing/spreadsheet/search.png)
This test case tests if a user can enter a search term in the navbar search box, hit the enter key and be presented with a correct set of results. This functionality is available to all users registered and unregistered.

## Mobile
![mobile](./media/testing/spreadsheet/mobile_testing.png)
It is important to properly verify that the site works at multiple resolutions on different devices such as phones and tablets. The Bootstrap framework used in this project is well-suited to managing responsive designs and it was confirmed that the site works on small devices. The navbar and menu collapse down to a smaller menu which works well on small screens.

## Third Party Testing

A user was recruited to test out the operation of the site while being observed. The user was unfamilar with the site, ans was requested to sign up for an account, browse the site and post a review on the site. They also added a book to their wishlist and lefta. comment on a review. After this test was finsihed, the user was also asked for any feedback they had on the functionality and design of the project.

A number of observations arose from this testing session:
* The user preferred the pages with colourful photo backgrounds compared to the original minimalist design I had used for most of the pages.
* The user had no problem navigating the site using the links in the header section.
* The original design for the book review form had many of the buttons the same colour, for example the buttons to edit and delete a review were both yellow. The colours were changed to make this less confusing and differentiate the options available. 

This feedback was incorporated into the development of the project.


### Unit Testing

Unit testing for this project was commenced but not completed. Coverage of 100% was achieved on the models.py file and 75% on the views.py file of the main project app. The overall test coverage was 88%.
